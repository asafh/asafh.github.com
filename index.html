Born and raised in Israel. I love being out in the sun and deep in the water, my hobbies being scuba diving and rock climbing. <br/>
I'm a dog person beyond any doubt. (<a href="#" id="proof">Proof</a>)<br/>
My spare time is never put to waste, I make sure it is all spent being with my family and friends, and tinkering with new technologies. <br/>
I have a B.Sc. in Computer Science from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_University_of_Jerusalem">HUJI</a>, and I'm currently an employee of <a href="http://www.liveperson.com">Liveperson</a>
