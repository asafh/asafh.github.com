I'm a dog person beyond any doubt. <br/>

I love being out in the sun and deep in the water, my hobbies are scuba diving and rock climbing and traveling. <br/>

I make sure to put my time into good use, spending it improving myself, learning new things, or being with my family and friends. I don't dare waste the freedom I am lucky enough to have. <br/>

I have a B.Sc. in Computer Science from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_University_of_Jerusalem">HUJI</a>, and I'm currently an employee of <a href="http://www.liveperson.com">Liveperson</a>
