# Site Generator
I used [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll), a static site generator, to generate the contents of this site.  
I started by looking at [m8ck](https://github.com/m8ck/m8ck.github.com)'s [site](http://m8ck.github.com/) as a reference for a Jekyll setup.
I borrowed some elements from it, altough the end result ended up quite different.

* [Bootswatch](http://bootswatch.com/)'s [Readable](http://bootswatch.com/readable/) theme for Bootstrap.
