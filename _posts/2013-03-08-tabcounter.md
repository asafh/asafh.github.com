title: Chrome Tab Counter
description: Simple tab/window counter Chrome extension 
---
This isn't very interesting so I'll keep it short:  
* I have the tendency to pile up tabs, huge amount of tabs. In order to keep myself in check I like to know how many tabs I actually have open.  
* I used to have an extension that (amongst other things) did that, but I got rid of it because it needed permissions I was uncomfortable with.  
* Unaware that I was searching under Apps rather than extensions, I couldn't find a tab counter in the Chrome Web Store.
* I wrote a simple extension that shows an indicator (a Badge on a Browser Action) of the number of tabs or windows open

You can use it to count the number of tabs or windows open (alternating by clicking the icon).
